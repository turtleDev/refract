Refract is a music player for public slack channels.

A lot of slack teams have a channel dedicated to sharing music. It's a nice place to discover new music, however it can become quite tedious to keep track of the links. What if all you wanted was to listen to the music that people post on that channel? Like a radio or a jukebox? Unfortunately slack doesn't have that feature to let you play the links posted on a channel.

Enter Refract.

Refract collects the youtube links posted on channels and then creates a playlist that can be navigated like a normal music player.
